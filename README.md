# CTESN_surrogates

This repository contains code to create surrogate models using Continuous Time Echo State Networks (CTESNs), which was used to produce results in the paper "Investigating the Surrogate Modeling Capabilities of Continuous Time Echo State Networks" by Saakaar Bhatnagar, MCA 2024. The attached data generation script will produce data to create surrogates for robertson's equation, parametrizing the reaction rate of the problem
